This document explains how to use GrabKit in your own project.


First, be sure you have [followed the instructions](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/wiki/How-to-run-GrabKit's-demo-application)  to run GrabKit's demo application. This step is necessary to solve dependancies.


***

Drag'n'drop GrabKit's xcodeproj in your own project

[[https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/raw/master/doc/installation/01.png]]

***

In your target settings, go to Build Phase -> Target Dependencies -> click on +

[[https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/raw/master/doc/installation/02.png]]

***

Under the "GrabKit" sub project, select "GrabKitLib" and "GrabKitBundle".

***

In your target settings, go to Build Phase -> link binary with libraries -> click on +
[[https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/raw/master/doc/installation/04.png]]

***

Under the workspace section, select "GrabKitLib.a".  Also add the following frameworks :
  * Accounts.framework (for Facebook SDK)
  * AdSupport.framework (for Facebook SDK)
  * AssetsLibrary.framework (for the Device Grabber)
  * CFNetwork.framework (for the FlickR Lib)
  * Security.framework (for the Picasa Lib)
  * Social.framework (for Facebook SDK)
  * SystemConfiguration.framework (for the Picasa Lib)

***

In your project explorer, find "grabKitBundle.bundle" and drag it to your Target settings -> Build Phase -> Copy Bundle Resources 
[[https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/raw/master/doc/installation/06.png]]

***

In your Target settings -> Build Settings, search for "Other linker flags", and add the following values :
	-all_load
	-ObjC
	-lxml2
	-lsqlite3.0

***

Still in "Build Settings", search for "header search path" and add the following values : 
  * $(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/include/GrabKitLib
  * /usr/include/libxml2

Import the FacebookSDK in your project
You can either download it and follow the included informations : https://developers.facebook.com/ios/downloads/
Or you can copy the version already included in the project.

***

Once you've imported FacebookSDK in your project, drag-and-drop it to your target settings -> Build Phase -> link binary with libraries

In your own appDelegate, add this import :
	
	#import "GrabKit.h"


Try to build. If you have some errors, check this procedure again.
If you don't have errors : Congratulations ! Only a few steps left before you can configure your project :) 

First, copy the class myGrabKitConfigurator from the demo application to your own project. 
( The configuration process will guide you through the customization of this file )


In your AppDelegate, in the AppDelegate:didFinishLaunching: method, add the following :

    [GRKConfiguration initializeWithConfiguratorClassName:@"myGrabKitConfigurator"];
    // You can also initialize GRKConfiguration with an instance of your configurator :
    // [GRKConfiguration initializeWithConfigurator:[ [GRKDemoConfigurator alloc] init]];
    
    
Still in your AppDelegate, add the following method : 

	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {
		
	    BOOL urlHasBeenHandledByDispatcher = [[GRKConnectorsDispatcher sharedInstance] dispatchURLToConnectingServiceConnector:url];
	    
	    if ( urlHasBeenHandledByDispatcher  ) return YES;
	    
	    // If you have specific URL schemes to handle for you application, 
	    //  the GRKConnectorDispatcher won't handle the URL. 
	    // Then, you can handle here your own URL schemes.
	    
	    return NO;
	}
	


Still in your AppDelegate, update the applicationDidBecomeActive: methods this way :
	
	- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
	{
 		[[GRKConnectorsDispatcher sharedInstance] applicationDidBecomeActive];
    
	}

	
	
	
	
You're done ! :) your project is now ready to be [configured](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/wiki/How-to-configure-GrabKit)  !
